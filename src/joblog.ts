// Job-log sourcing — the zero-plumbing way to feed Sift (`target-job` input).
// Instead of tee-ing a build step into a file, a later job (`needs: <build>`)
// points Sift at the finished job by NAME; the action downloads that job's log
// from the GitHub API AS BYTES, declares the delivery stack those bytes carry,
// and (optionally) selects the user-marked capture sections. No shell plumbing in
// the build job, and no byte of any line rewritten (DN-89.D38).
//
// THE ACTION NEVER PEELS A DELIVERY LAYER. The API stamps every line with an RFC
// 3339 time and opens each job segment with a byte-order mark; those are the
// declared stack `utf8-bom-line-prefix,api-rfc3339-line-prefix`, and the ENGINE
// peels them under that declaration (ADR-23.D8). The hand-rolled strip this file
// once carried removed one space after a stamp, dropped every CR and the first
// line's mark, and was invisible to the engine (DN-89.D38).
//
// Capture markers — plain lines the build steps emit (`echo`):
//   SIFT_CAPTURE            open an anonymous section
//   SIFT_CAPTURE <name>     open a named section (independent baseline lineages
//                           from one job: ci vs release, etc.)
//   SIFT_CAPTURE_END        close the open section
// A line is a marker when its PAYLOAD is exactly one of those, the payload being
// what is left behind the delivery head (`markerPayload`). Matching is exact on the
// whole payload, so the runner's script-echo of `echo "SIFT_CAPTURE ci"` in the
// ##[group] header can never false-match. The `capture` input selects: `auto`
// (default — if any sections exist use them all, else the whole log), `off` (whole
// log always), or a section name (only that section's parts; absent ⇒ config
// error, fail loud). A selection forwards whole lines, byte for byte, each with its
// own terminator; marker lines are not forwarded.
//
// The target job must be COMPLETED (the API serves logs for finished jobs), so
// the Sift invocation lives in a job that `needs:` it — which is also what makes
// `changed-outcome: ${{ needs.<job>.result }}` trivial for the caller.
