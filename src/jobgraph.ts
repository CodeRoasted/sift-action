// The CHANGED run's declared `needs:` job graph — this Action's producer of the ADR-22.D13
// wire (`--changed-job-graph`, a JSON file behind a flag). The engine folds a required-check
// aggregator row into the member that actually failed, but only from a DECLARED graph: `needs:`
// is a static list in the workflow file that cannot carry expressions, which is what makes the
// edge a declaration rather than a guess (ADR-22.D5 — acquisition derives, never infers).
//
// The acquisition mirrors the crawler's (insight-eidos sift/src/crawl/job_graph.cpp) because the
// two are the SAME producer contract over different transports, and a divergence between them
// would be a silent fork of one wire. Same rules, stated where they bind below: verbatim `name:`,
// the exactly-one conclusion refusal, key-less quoted renderings, and the jobs listing read on
// every workflow, edge or none.
//
// THE RENDERING GRAMMAR IS STATED HERE ONCE IN TYPESCRIPT (DN-127.D1): the separator, the matrix-leg
// opener, the expression delimiters, the one template matcher and its guard, and the reach under the
// collision refusal. Its C++ statement is insight-eidos `sift/src/job_rendering.hpp`; one case table,
// copied byte for byte into both repositories (here `tests/fixtures/job_rendering_cases.json`) and
// compared by a superproject check, keeps the two one rule.
//
// ⚠ WHY js-yaml AND NOT A SUBSET PARSER OF OUR OWN — the choice IS the point. The input is a
// workflow file a contributor can influence, and a hand-rolled reader would be a second reader of
// a format we do not own, over hostile-capable bytes, inside the one path whose whole
// justification is "declarations and no heuristic". js-yaml v4's `load` uses the expression-free
// default schema (no code execution, no !!js types), and the bytes arrive under the contents
// API's own response cap.
//
// READ AT EVERY GRAIN. The graph has three readers in the engine: the job-grain claim frame (a
// row's own job's declared conclusion, DN-89.D15), step naming (a listed step declared failed,
// named on its job's row, DN-140.D5), and the `needs:` fold. The first two are correct on one
// job's log. The fold needs rows from two jobs, and the engine refuses a fold whose aggregator and
// member claim one row (DN-118.O3, part 3), so a `target-job` diff mints no fold row; DN-118.D4
// kept the read off that grain until the pinned engine carried that refusal, and is withdrawn.
//
// FAIL-SOFT BY DESIGN, and absent ≠ empty: every acquisition failure (no runner coordinate for the
// executed workflow file, an unreadable file, a denied `contents: read`, a failed jobs listing) resolves to ABSENT — no flag,
// fold inert, run unaffected — with one log line naming the reason, because a fold that silently
// stopped firing reads exactly like a clean run. A workflow that genuinely declares zero jobs is
// DECLARED-EMPTY (`[]`), a different fact the engine acts on.
