// read behind the delivery head. Plus the job lookup's fail-loud contract (missing / ambiguous /
// not-completed), the per-input byte ceiling, and the acquired-grain line.
//
// Arms A1 (the target-job half), A2, A3, A4 and A5 of DN-89.D38 live here. Every arm drives the
// one public seam, `fetchTargetJobLog`, against a client that behaves like the real one: asked
// for the body unparsed, it streams the served bytes in small chunks; asked the default way, it
// hands back the body DECODED as text, as GitHub's `text/plain` makes octokit do (measured at
// gate G1, coderoast-corpora f7149a2: 741 383 bytes as a string against 741 386 on the wire).
// So a regression of the request shows up as wrong bytes, not only as a wrong option.
//
// The fixtures are written by hand rather than taken from a real job log: the four hazards A2
// names (a mark at offset 0, a CRLF line, an ill-formed byte, a run of spaces after a stamp) are
// not all present in any one served log, and G1 already holds the real-bytes evidence for the
// request. Every byte is built from a code point or a literal below; nothing is read from disk.
